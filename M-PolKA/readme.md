# M-PolKA
M-PolKA (Multipath Polynomial Key-based Architecture)is a topology-agnostic multipath source routing architecture, which explores special properties from the RNS polynomial arithmetic and redefines the RNS coding for the representation of multipath routes. Thus, a myriad of new avenues will be open, from duplication of traffic through disjoint routes to multicast trees, could be properly represented. Therefore, M-PolKA is expected to deliver not only topology-agnostic solutions for controlability, but also answers to end-to-end (E2E) performance issues.

# RARE/FreeRtr

Freertr is a control plane: Router OS process speaks various network protocols, (re)encap packets, and exports forwarding tables to hardware switches. Basically, it is only necessary to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Below is demonstrated how to install it on operating systems: Linux, Windows and macOS.
